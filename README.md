## About
Select the servers you don't want to play on and click apply changes. If you're running the game, please restart your game for the changes to take affect.

This application updates the Windows 'hosts' file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts) and must be ran as administrator to be able to access and update the hosts file

This application relies on a local server list file which can be updated to keep on top of changes made to the game server addresses (they change the IP addresses sometimes). If a server you were previously blocking becomes accessible in-game again then try check for an updated server list file here; or manually edit the server list file with the changed address.

>***Warning: Blocking game servers may increase matchmaking search times depending on your location and the servers you block***

## Download
The application and server list file downloads can be found in Releases. You must have the server list file with the application or it will not work.
